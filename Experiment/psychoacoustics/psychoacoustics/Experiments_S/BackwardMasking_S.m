% A 20-ms, 1-kHz pure tone (the signal) is presented immediately before
% (i.e., no silent gap) a band of bandpass noise of 300-ms (400-1600 Hz).
% All sounds are onset and offset gated by means of two raised cosine onset
% and offset ramps of 10-ms. The subject has to detect the tone (in yes/no
% task) or to tell which interval has the tone.
% - PARAMETER VARIED ADAPTIVELY: the level of the signal;
% - STANDARD LEVEL: here it corresponds to the signal's catch trial level.
% !!!PLEASE NOTE THAT THE EXACT SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL AT LISTENER'S EAR MUST
% BE DETERMINED APART BY MEANS OF AN ADEQUATE HARDWARE!!!
