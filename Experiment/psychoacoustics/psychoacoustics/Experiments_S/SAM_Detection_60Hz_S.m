% Sinusoidal Amplitude Modulation (SAM) noise discrimination. A 500-ms
% Gaussian noise is sinusoidally amplitude modulated at 60-Hz. The depth
% of the modulation is expressed as 20log(m), where m is a modulation index
% that ranges from 0.0 (no modulation) to 1.0 (full modulation). The
% subject has to detect the modulation (in yes/no task) or to tell which
% interval has the modulated noise. Modulated and unmodulated stimuli are
% equated for total RMS power. Noises have two 10-ms raised cosine ramps at
% onset and offset. The threshold is the modulation depth (in dB).
% - PARAMETER VARIED ADAPTIVELY: the modulation depth of the variable noise
% expressed as 20*log(m) where m is the modulation index that ranges from 0
% (no mudulation) to 1 (full modulation);
% - STANDARD LEVEL: in the current experiment it has no use.
