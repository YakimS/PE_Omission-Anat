% ITD discrimination for a 330-Hz, 250-ms pure tone. The subject has to
% tell whether the leading tone of the tone pair comes from the left or
% from the right. Both tones have a certain ITD. This task is identical to
% Saberi and Green (P&P, 1997).
% - PARAMETER VARIED ADAPTIVELY: the ITD of the variable tone (here it is
% the left tone). The same ITD value is also used for the standard tone
% however, with opposite sign;
% - STANDARD LEVEL: in the current experiment it has no use.
