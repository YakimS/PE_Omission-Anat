% Gap detection. A band of 750-ms gaussian noise has a gap in its temporal
% center. Gap duration is varied according to the listener performance. The
% noise has 0.5-ms cosine ramps at the beginning and end of the gap. In
% nI-nAFC tasks, the standard is always a 750-ms broadband noise with no
% gap whereas the variable contains the gap.
% - PARAMETER VARIED ADAPTIVELY: the duration of the gap;
% - STANDARD LEVEL: here it corresponds to the overall noise duration.
