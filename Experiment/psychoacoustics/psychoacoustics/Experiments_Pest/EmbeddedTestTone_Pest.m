% Subjects listen for one member of a sequence of nine tones with
% frequencies ranging from 300 to 3000-Hz. A different, randomly selected
% series of nine tones is presented on each trial. The task is to detect
% the presence of the fifth tone in the sequence. The tone is absent in the
% standard. The duration of all tones except the fifth, or target tone, is
% 40-ms. All tones have 2.5-ms raised cosine onset and offset gates. The
% test is made more difficult by reducing the duration of the target tone.
% - PARAMETER VARIED ADAPTIVELY: the duration of the middle tone;
% - STANDARD LEVEL: the duration of the remaining tones.
