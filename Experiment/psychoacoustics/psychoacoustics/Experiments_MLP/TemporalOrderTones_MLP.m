% Temporal order for tones. The task is to discriminate the order in which
% two equal-duration pure tones of 550 and 710-Hz are presented. The
% duration of the two tones is varied according to listener performance.
% Tones are presented without a gap between them and are preceded and
% followed, without gaps, by 100-ms ?leader? and ?trailer? tones at 625-Hz.
% The onset and offset of the tones are gated with two 10-ms raised cosine
% ramps.
% - PARAMETER VARIED ADAPTIVELY: the duration of the middle tone;
% - STANDARD LEVEL: in the current experiment standard level has no use.
