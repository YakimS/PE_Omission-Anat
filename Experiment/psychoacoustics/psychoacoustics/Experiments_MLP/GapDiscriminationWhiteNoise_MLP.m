% Gap-duration discrimination. The standard is a 750-ms Gaussian noise with
% a silent of standard duration placed at its temporal center. The variable
% has a variable gap duration and the length of its gap is changed as
% function of the subject performance. All noises have a 0.5-ms cosine ramp
% at onset and offset.
% - PARAMETER VARIED ADAPTIVELY: the duration of the variable-noise gap;
% - STANDARD LEVEL: here it corresponds to the duration of the
% standard-noise gap.
