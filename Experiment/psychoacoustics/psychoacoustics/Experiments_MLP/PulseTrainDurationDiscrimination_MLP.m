% Pulse-train discrimination. The standard stimulus consists of six 20-ms
% pulses of a 1-kHz tone. These pulses are arranged in three pairs, with 40
% ms of silence between members of a pair and 120 ms between pairs. The
% temporal structure of the variable sequence is varied by increasing the
% separation between members of each pair, with a corresponding decrease in
% the between-pair time and, thus, a constant interval between the first
% tones in each of the successive pairs. Thus, the first, third, and fifth
% tones are fixed in time, while the onsets of the second, fourth, and
% sixth tones are delayed by varying amounts.
% - PARAMETER VARIED ADAPTIVELY: the duration of the gap within/between
% pairs of the variable stimulus;
% - STANDARD LEVEL: the duration of the gap within/between pairs of the
% standard stimulus
